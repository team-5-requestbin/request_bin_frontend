Wednesday/Thursday todos:

# FUNCTIONALITY:

- generate test requests which query our target endpoint
- checking local storage, populating local storage (persistent sessions, we are storing previously used endpoints)
- make our "copy to clipboard"
- update current url when we click "create new endpoint" (History API)

# UI:

- `currentlyViewed` needs attention, toggling between "default view" and the currentlyViewed
- breaking down the "currently viewed request" data
